-- ─── Customer texts for manually-entered operator bookings ────────────────────
-- Bookings created in the operator dashboard were NOT getting the customer
-- confirmation ("update") or 24-hour reminder texts: those are enqueued by the
-- website's booking flow, and the operator path only inserts into `bookings`.
-- There is no DB-level enqueue, so manual bookings were silently skipped.
--
-- Fix: a trigger that enqueues the SAME notification_queue rows the existing
-- processor already sends (received/sms + reminder_24h/sms are both present in
-- notification_log, proving the processor delivers them). Gated to
-- source='operator' so website bookings are never double-texted.
